## Session: Systems

### Key Ideas 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_star_778913_003F72.svg">

*	A system's structure determines it's behavior 
* A system is a whole with properities that none of it's parts has 
* System parts are defined by their relationship to the whole. It is not effective to focus on solving problems in isolation
* Zooming out and in is the key skill of systems thinking 


### Terms

* System: "an interconnected set of elements, coherently organized in a way that achieves something"
* System Behavior: Emerges from the dynamic interactions of system components.
    + We define limited EBP reach as a system behavior  

### Dialogue- Hexagon Icon

* Discuss slinky and Car parts, briefly describe how each relates to equifinality and multifinality

### Learning Loop

* Reintroduce mental models from participatory session- in this exercise we will make mental models explicit 

* **Graphs Over Time Exercise**
    + Facilitate stakeholders choosing a variable of interest and diagramming its change over time
    + Post graphs and facilitate discussion of how the various graphs are related, beginning to talk about them as a system  
    
### Lesson Overview "Putting it Together"

* In order to change an undesirable system behavior (like limited EBP reach) we need to understand the system that produces it. We do this by zooming in to understand elements in detail and zooming out to contextualize them in the whole (iteratively). 

* **Coming Up**
    + We will make the dynamics between the system elements we modeled today more explicit
    + We will explore feedback in-depth
    + Stakeholders will explore their own data to see those feedback dynamics at work 

## Complex

Introduce system thinking by discussing how the problem that we're attempting to address (in this case limited EBP reach) persists because it is complex- there isn't a linear cause and effect. It is the result of multiple interrlated variables with levels that change dynamiclly over time. 


## Interconnected 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_team_981174_003F72.svg" width="240" height="180">

We define limited EBP reach as a system behavior, a product of the interaction of system components. Each part of the system is dependent for effect on other parts, no part works in isolation. The complexity and interconnectedness of the clinic system means we cannot possibly understand it intuitively. It is impossible to hold the rates, states and interactions of all of the relevant variables in our heads, especially as they change over time. one of the value adds of the PSDM approach is that we move to a model, an external representation of the system that can display complexity and interconnectedness of these variables in a coherant way.
     

## Structure Determines Behavior 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_slinky_48148_000000.svg" width="240" height="180">

One of the teaching examples commonly used to illustrate systems thinking is the slinky. Hold a slinky from the top and bottom then release your bottom hand so it drops and bounces up and down until it is stil. Then ask the group: why did that happen to the slinky? Why did it bounce up and down? Some common answers might be- "because you released your bottom hand" or "because of gravity". If these answers are given point out that if you did the same thing with a notebook it wouldn't bounce back it would simply hit the ground. Then explain that the structure of the slinky, its coils, causes the physical behavior of it bouncing up and down. Similarly, the structure of the clinical setting (the way all interreltated components interact) produces the behavior of limited EBP reach.The system structure determines how it reacts to outside forces (like national change efforts), similarly to how the slinky structure determines how it reacts to gravity. Because the behavior we want to change is determined by the system structure, change efforts need to target that structure. We must understand the underlying structure in order to find points of levarage to target. In this session we hope to help frontline staff come to a more "systems" understanding of their setting.


## Function of a System 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_roofless-car_564275_003F72.svg" 
      width="240" height="180">

A system is an "interconnected set of elements organized in a way that achieves something" (Meadows) in other words a system has functions that none of its parts has individually. For instance a car gets you from point A to B, its engine doesn't. You can write, your hand can't write. (Ackoff) Our healthcare system's function is to meet the need of the veteran, no individual part whether it be referral, scheduling, intake can meet the need alone. When a system is taken apart it loses its essential properties, one reason it is important to use systems thinking to understand the current implementation problem. 

## System Components 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_car-tire_811766_003F72.svg"> <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_car-battery_811720_003F72.svg"> <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_car-keys_811748_003F72.svg"> <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_steering-wheel_167223_003F72.svg">

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_roofless-car_564275_003F72.svg" width="240" height="180">

Each part or component of a system is interrelated and dependent for effect on all other parts. No part functions independently, for instance a car's wheels don't function independently of the steering wheel and vice versa. Similarly all parts of our clinic system function in relation to the other parts for instance referral functions in relation to scheduling.

Another application of the car analogy in our clinic setting is that the performance of the system depends on the fit of the parts to that system, not how well they act taken separately. If you rated every possible car engine for performance, decided the "best" engine was from a ferrari and then put it in your honda the car wouldn't run. Which engine is "best" is determined by its fit in the overall system. Similarly the "best" implementation strategy is the one that best fits a particular clinic. In fact if you took the "best" functioning of every individual part of every car and tried to assemble a "super-car" you wouldn't even end up with a functional vehicle. Often when considering "best practices" we neglect to consider that they were successful in a particular system, taken out of that system they might not function at all. 

## Interconnectedness and Multifinality
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_molecule_784555_003F72.svg" width="240" height="180">

Because all parts of our clinic system are interconnected and dependent on one another for effect, any implementation strategy we select will impact not only the outcome we are hoping to improve but other outcomes of interest as well. Our current objective is to improve EBP reach but we certainly do not want to do so at the expense of number of clients served, wait times, clients completing general psychotherapy etc. One advantage of our PSD approach that uses systems thinking is that we can predict how any potential strategy will impact **multiple** outcomes of interest. This way we can select a strategy that not only improves EBP reach but works towards achieving multiple other clinic goals as well.   

## Purpose of the Session: Eliciting Mental Models 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_communication_884666_003F72.svg" width="240" height="180">

In today's session we will work toward eliciting the mental models that were discussed during the participatory session last time. The learning exercise I will introduce in a few moments will serve to help you think about variables in the clinic, such as drop-out as a result of interrelated clinic factors. This will hopefully get you thinking in systems and will illustrate the concepts we have discussed so far. 
      
## Zooming in and out 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_collapse_926266_000000%20(1).svg" width="240" height="180"> <img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_view_926267_000000.svg" width="240" height="180">

The key skill we hope to impart in this session is that of zooming in and out. Systems thinking assumes that in order to change an undesirable system behavior (like limited EBP reach) we need to understand the system that produces it. We do this by zooming in to understand elements in detail and zooming out to contextualize them in the whole. This skill in flexible thinking needs to be done iteratively over time to maintain a systems perspective on a dynamic and complex system. 

## Developing a System Story 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_full-network_674171_003F72.svg" width="240" height="180">

The following exercise will help you to elicit your mental model of how your clinic  functions and develop a greater system understanding of your setting. We will ask you to think about a single variable in the clinic and intuit which other interrelated variables influence where it stands currently and how it changes over time. For instance does season effect employee moral? How are they related? How would you predict moral is impacted by turnover?

## Exercise- Graphs Over Time 

Split into 6 groups, on the paper provided please draw a simple graph with time on the horizonal axis and level of the following variables on the verticle.
