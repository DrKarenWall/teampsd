- Model simulations provide a means to make mental models
more explicit and test assumptions, particularly surrounding implementation plans.

- Assist stakeholders in evaluating implementation plans by
using model simulation to visualize dynamic relationships.

- Increase stakeholder EBP-specific capacity by
understanding the impact of system factors, such as intake referral rate, on the level of state measures, such as amount of patients pending intake scheduling.


### Definitions 

- Static observation/Stock

- Dynamic observation

- Flows

- Feedback



### Dialogue- Hexagon

- What thoughts do providers have on variables in the model?

- What are some hypotheses about what is driving the rates of those variables?

- Discuss major stocks, feedback loops, and dynamics



### Learning Loop

-Group Model Building exercise: split up into groups and discuss 1) major stocks, 2) hypotheses about what is driving those stocks



### Lesson Overview 

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_molecule_784555_003F72.svg>

- The main role of simulation is to test hypotheses about the relationship between the system structure and system behavior using local data and local expertise.



## Healthcare

- “Have you ever made a big change in your clinic and it did nothing?” 
- If you understand linearity as the inputs and outputs being disproportionate, sometimes people work very hard and spend lots of time and lots of effort on something that’s kind of like a try it and see if it works, trial and error implementation plan and it turns out, lots of resources down the road, no impact. 
- On the other hand, a small pat on the back may not be giving you a nonlinear improvement, but maybe for you it’s a very reinforcing thing. 
- We talked previously about general quality improvement capacity and now we’re moving into how using these processes of general learning and coordination or general quality improvement capacities, how might you use the model to understand more EBP specific capacities that are local to each setting, each clinic in our healthcare system.

## Traffic Jam 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_traffic_924177_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-  The traffic jam example used previously typically resonates with people in terms of referrals because in the same way you can’t just change the number of people leaving work and getting onto the highway at the same time and filling the capacity of the highway, you can’t just wave a magic wand and change the number of patients in your clinic’s care.
- You can start to see that the interdependence between the people who refer to you, or whether or not the patients need gets met or needs to be referred elsewhere is not only an interdependence in the sense of human relations, but a time dependent relationship, and that there is delays there.
- That’s where this continuous time model, or a stock and flow model in system dynamics, becomes so valuable.

   
## Stock and Flow
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_washing_514155_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-	Stocks are the stakes or levels of variables. If you think about this, this is like if you did wave your magic wand and you suddenly froze the clinic, where would the patients  be, where would providers be.
-	In our system many managers have those levels, mean patients who get x y or z. what they don’t have is in their local setting what is driving those levels. 
-	And, given the nonlinear relations we’re talking about and the multifinality concerns you heard previously about systems, it would be helpful to actually test out hypotheses with those levels and see what the effects of different efforts would be. In essence, trying to improve our primary implementation goal without ruining any other primary factors in the clinic that are QI goals.
-	So this metaphor is frequently used, a tub or a sink, displaying the basic principle of a differential equation. You can know exactly mathematically when the sink will be filled, or when the highway from earlier will slow. Its when the rate of inflow exceeds the water being drained or cars getting off the highway, given the carrying capacity of the sink or road. 

## Static Observation 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_bar-chart-decline_869492_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- So with a static observation, if this were our EBP reach variable and we were thinking about clinic A B and C, and you were just looking at quarterly performance measures like we do in the VA, you might think, I definitely want to be clinic A (highest bar on the graph). 

## Dynamic Observation Over Time
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_line-chart_544281_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- But really what ends up happening is maybe clinic A is the upper line at quarter 1, quarter 2 they look bad, and quarter 3 they go back up.
- And if you start looking at things dynamically, the question starts to become, particularly in clinics that have a lot of instability, what is causing all of this ongoing variability, and what can we do to actually try to better maximize and utilize our resources rather than having such inconsistencies.

## Modeling to Learn
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_communication_884666_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-	And so in order to move to doing something like that, we’ve talked a lot about  moving from this qualitative to quantitate model and trying to generalize nationally the modeling PROCESS- not the model itself-. 
-	We want to engage all the stakeholders, elicit their mental models, make them explicit in a formal algebraic and differential equation model.

## System Behavior -

-  The first step is model specification, determining what variables and relationships appear most important.
- We use administrative data that everyone has, and common procedural technology. 
-  We run various scenarios that staff have always wanted to test but weren’t sure if they could get their colleagues on board to try. By doing this, we are going from individual mental models to a shared model that’s actually formally testable and has the psychological safety to be wrong, to try things virtually without expending a bunch of resources and without running the risk that you’ve got dozens of providers and thousands of patients impacted.
- And then after you’ve enacted the plan that you’ve identified through simulation you can use the model as a monitoring or evaluation tool.  

## Local Data

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_slinky_48148_000000.svg" width="720" height="540"> 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_settings_339117_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- But let’s think back to the slinky metaphor. Why did that slinky bounce up and down? (The structure of the slinky, its coils, causes the physical behavior of it bouncing up and down). The structure determines the behavior with the slinky, and with the clinical setting. National change efforts targeted at limited EBP reach are not accounting for local system structure. We have to understand the local structure to understand the behavior of limited EBP reach. The question of "why would that work here" can only be understood by using our local data and focusing on local systems. Remember that without system dynamics we tend to operate under the equifinality assumption that diverse initial conditions and organizational pathways may result in the same outcome.

## Feedback
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651873_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">
 - In coming to a “systems” understanding of the clinical setting, we must remember to identify major feedback loops as well as major stocks in the system.
 - Point to graphs over time exercise and the understanding of what feedback loops appear important for their system.  



## Synthesis

- As we get more specific, we conduct model reviews and clean up the model
- During the review, we pay specific attention to variables and linkages that needed changes or were questionable. Every one of our parameters can be played with with very simple changes to the script. That way, people can see real time the answers to their questions about what would happen if we changed x, y, or z. 
- There may be several model reviewing sessions prior to moving on
- Throughout this process, particularly as we simplify the model, we make sure we are using a system dynamics approach 


## Learning Loop Exercise : Modeling to Learn

- Group model building exercise
- At this point, we would like participants to engage in a model building exercise. 
- People should break up into groups and come up with at least 5 hypotheses about what is driving their clinic measures. 

## Lesson Overview/Debrief

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_molecule_784555_003F72.svg width="720" height="540">
 - Review with participants the hypotheses they came up with
 - What mental models were made explicit? Were there differences in mental models? Did people come to
a consensus? What feedback loops were identified? What questions remain?
-	Recall that the main role of simulation is to test hypotheses about the relationship between the system structure and system behavior using local data and local expertise. We
will continue to conduct modeling sessions to simplify and test the model.
