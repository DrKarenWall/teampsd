## Session: Dynamics, Session 1

### Key Ideas 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_star_778913_003F72.svg">

* Employees are willing to perform and provide quality work, but their success is directly tied to and limited by the nature of the system they are working in. 
* Quality improvement strategies and provider morale are closely linked. 
* it is important to directly engage frontline staff in a co-learning process that understands tradeoffs in the system (e.g., outcomes and burnout) and maximizes the functioning of the whole system. 

### Terms

* Dynamic hypothesis  
* Trade Off
* General Quality Improvement Capacity
* EBP Specific Capacity

### Dialogue

* Explore the difference between being on a bowling team and in a band. 
* Discuss Red Beads Exercise

### Learning Loop (Practice/ Exercise)

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_synchronize_778914_003F72.svg">

* Initiating and elaborating a causal loop diagram. Developing a dynamic hypothesis for “limited EBP reach” 

    
## Lesson Overview "Putting it Together"

* The greater the interdependence of the system, the greater the need for learning and coordination. In order to model to learn, we need participation and to elicit mental models and make them explicit 
* The data used in this approach emerge out of the interactions of the whole system. Want stakeholders to see the whole system behavior and its parts in new ways. Want them to be able to zoom in and zoom out.

* Coming Up



### Narrative

## Quality Improvement Efforts Often Fail

“How many of you have ever felt frustrated that they system would not let you do your work? What agency did you feel like you had to change that? How many of you have had data or numbers used for performance improvement initiatives? How were the data used?

Often, previously used QI strategies and data may not feel valid or useful because they do not address the fundamental dynamics at play in the system. Data can also be used to punish or reward, which can lead to policy resistance, and does not make sense if the data don't address the full dynamics of the system. In this approach, we view success as being directly tied to and limited by the system you are working in. Does anyone remember what we learned from the idea of the slinky? (Structure determines behavior).

## Success is Dependent on the System 

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_full-network_674171_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Many quality improvement efforts that are selected fail because they lead to policy resistance, burnout, turnover, low morale, etc. These approaches are unsuccessful because they do not take into account the fundamental dynamics at play in the system. They fail to take into account the feedback in the system, in other words, what effect the effort will have on providers, and how that will then impact the success of the initiative.

## Measuring Performance

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_team_981174_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

When we talk about success in an initiative, it's important to also discuss how success is measured. How performance is measured can vary by the type of team you are on. For example, if we were part of a bowling team our performance is defined by our individual scores that get added to the team score. If we are part of a band, though, our performance is determined by how we play together. We want to think about our performance as if we were a band. Thinking about how a whole system functions together may be a very different approach than what has previously been done with performance measures, etc, when data can be used against providers. 
 
## Alternative Approach

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_idea_884671_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">
In this approach, we will take a totally different approach, with a focus on learning together and prioritizing the things that frontline staff care most about. 

## Zooming in and out 

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_collapse_926266_000000%20(1).svg width="240" height="180">

To do this, we will need to be able to look at data in a way that is not punishing. This is different than how data are often used. For example, we may think data looks very clear – think “bad numbers” v “good numbers” – but that may not be providing the information we think it is and we might miss important information if we just look at a snapshot of the data.  So we need to look at the whole system that you are working in - zooming in to look at specific pieces of the picture but also zooming out to make sure we zoom out to optimize parts in terms of the whole.

## Tradeoffs

In order to understanding the effect of a change initative in the whole system functioning we need to understand tradeoffs. For example, the tradeoff between a quality improvement strategy selected and how this strategy impacts staff (which will of course then feedback and impact the success of the quality improvement strategy). Given the interdependencies in the system, processes should be optimized in a way that leads to the benefit of the whole system to meet the needs of the Veteran. 

## Increasing general and specific capacity

Over the coming weeks, we are going to cover a lot of information that helps us do this. By using this approach, we hope to not only increase the capacity of staff to improve EBP reach, but generally to increase capacity to look at a whole system and make meaningful changes to the system. 

To get started, we are going to start to learn about causal loops, using an example of the feedback between a quality improvement strategy and the effect it has on staff.
