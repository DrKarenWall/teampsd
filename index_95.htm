		Hi Lindsey! In trying to add links to the Sharepoint, etc., I figured out that what I sent earlier was unfortunately not an HTML email.
		I was using Outlook templates earlier, which is why I was having a sizing issue since it's not a dynamic interface but a template put 
		together with pictures and formatting... But I finally figured out how to put this version together - took much longer, but was really fun!
		All of the hyperlinks should work and the Contact Us should open up an email to both of us.
		
		<br> <br>
		Oh also, in terms of me being able to view/edit your calendar: 
	
		<br>
		You just go to Calendar > Calendar Permissions > Add > Change Permission level in the drop down.
	
		<br>
		This <a href = "http://help.unc.edu/help/office-365-what-are-permission-levels-in-outlook/">website</a> shows you what each of the persmissions mean.
	
		<br> <br>
		Thanks,
	
		<br>
		Stacey
