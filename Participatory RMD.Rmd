## Session: Participatory

### Key Ideas

*	Modeling to learn includes making mental models explicit 
* Co-creating a shared vision for utilizing modeling to learn process will help individual visions fit together with other colleagues 
* Making mental models explicit includes formulating a model that will help with specific quality improvement strategies to improve EBP reach


### Terms

* Model to Learn: 
* Mental Model: images, assumptions and stories which we carry in our minds of ourselves, other people, institutions, and every aspect of the world (i.e., internal pictures of the world)
* Shared Vision: building sense of commitment in a group by developing shared images of the future sought to create and principles guiding practices by which we hope to get there
* Participatory:

### Dialogue- Hexagon Icon

* Discuss modeling to learn and shared vision to develop a co-created understanding of the problem together

### Learning Loop

* Circles exercise: Introduce modeling to learn, given that individual perspectives of the problem are incomplete
* Elephant metaphor: Introduce shared vision for the project of using modeling

* **Shared Vision Exercise**
    + Facilitate stakeholders process of creating a vision and understanding of the modeling to learn project process and goals together
    + Facilitate discussion to revise long-term project goals
    
### Lesson Overview "Putting it Together"

* In order to address needs for learning and coordination for limited EBP reach, a participatory approach is necessary to connect individuals, a PSD process elicits mental models and dialogue together makes them explicit

* **Coming Up**
    + We will discuss system structures and its influence on behavior
    + We will explore system dynamics that will help with developing a model further in the PSD process
