## Session: Dynamics

### Key Ideas 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_star_778913_003F72.svg">

* Systems are composed of a web of interrelated stocks, flows, and feedback processes that occur over time.
* Systems tend to are goal-seekg or drift toward a “normal state” because of the dynamic relationship between positive and negative feedback loops (CITE: Gosh) 
* Unexpected system behaviors occur frequently in systems. These unintended consequences are often the result of delays in feedback or nonlinear system behaviors. 
* An enhanced understanding of the dynamics that exist system behaviors will empower stakeholders to make informed change initiatives within their system.


### Key Terms

### Dialogue- Hexagon Icon
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_750723_003F72.svg">

* Have you ever made a small change and it had a huge effect? Conversely, have you ever made a huge effort to make a change only to have make a small impact?
* A central focus of our discussion will be to understand the implications of feedbacks and nonlinearities to help understand how some change-decisions can have such varying impacts on a system. 
* We want to assist each other to understand the dynamic relationships that exist within the systems, and learn about the structure in which we are embedded.
* Through this process, we will expand our mental models of the boundaries of a system, and go beyond linear cause and effect relationships in order to make informed clinic decisions.

### Learning Loop

* **Ratio Exercise**
    + Following our discussion about key conecpts about dynamics, we will map variables proposed by stakeholders and thier ratio or differences in relation to one another. 
    + Using the stock and flow diagram presented earlier, ask stakeholders to tell feedback stories that account for the ratio of the variables being mapped.
    
### Lesson Overview "Putting it Together"

### Positive Feedback
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651874_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Positive feedback loops amplify or reinforce a variable in the system. They generate their own exponential growth by feedbing back on a variable over time. 

### Negative Feedback
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651876_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Negative feedback loops are goal-seeking and drive the system towards equilibrium. They are sources of stability, control, and resistance to change within a system. (Cite: Meadows). Later on, we will map out variables and designate thier differneces using positive and negative feedback loops. 

### Role of Delays  
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_redo_993290_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Delays are ever-present throughout systems and account for system behaviors such as oscillations, collapses and overshoots. Each stock and each flow is a delay. Stakeholders often fail to accurately assess the length of delays and their impact on the system. (Cite:Meadows)
For example, stakeholders are challgned to appreciate the delays between thier action, the system's reponse, and the feedback of information that follows (cite: senge)

### Traffic 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_traffic_924177_003F72.svg width="240" height="180"> 

The example of traffic during rush hour is a great example of how something seemingly ahead of us is impacting our ability to act, in this case get home from work. Regardless of how fast you want to get to your destination, there is a feedback process that is slowing the speed at which you want to get on to the freeway. In systems, the stock can impact the flow, and the flow can impact the stock. In the traffic example, the cars on the road or the stock influences the rate in which the driver can get on to the freeway or the flow. This means that the stock is dictating the flow, the rate at which cars can get on to the freeway. Humans are linear cause and effect thinkers. We typically see the happenings of the world as a series of events, and rarely account for feedback. (cite: Meadows) We can apply what happens during traffic hour to the clinics. The state of the clinic or stock impacts the rate of patient referrals or flow into and out of the clinic. 

### Static Observation 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_interactive-bar-chart_151004_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Static observations provide limited information for stakeholders about how variables within thier system interact, change, and evolve over time. Quarterly reports of clinic performance are static observations. While these snapshots of the clinic may provide some information, they do not tell the whole story. 


### Dynamic Observation
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_line-chart_544281_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Observation that provides information about the system’s past, present, and future behavior. Using dynamic observations, stakeholders are able to identify leverage points within the system and make informed decisions about change-efforts. 

### Nonlinear System Behavior- Exponential Growth
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_graph_87995_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

A nonlinear relationship can be defined as an interaction where the input is disproportional to the output. The changes in a stock produce shifts in the relationships between variables that are not proportional. (meadows) Exponential growth of a variable occurs when positive or reinforcing feedback loop of a given stock becomes dominant within a system over time. Growth can occur suddenly after a long period of little or no change. Using PSD, stakeholders may be able to forecast that over time, change initiatives will take-off exponenetially. 

### Nonlinear System Behavior- Steady State
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_graph_88002_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Similar to exponential growth, a nonlinear relationship has inputs that are not proportionate the outputs that cause system behaviors that may be difficult to understand or forsee. Instead of growth, a steady state refers to the negative feedback loops resisting growth to create a system behavior of equilibrium. A steady state can provide stakeholders with valuable infromation to help understand leverage points to affect change. Soemtimes, it may demonstrate that the clinic is performing at max capicty with the current amount of resources.

### System Behavior– Oscillation
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_sine-wave_385866_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Oscillations occur as a result of delays throughout the system. These delays occur in multiple feedback interactions at different ratios. Stakeholders often undershoot or overshoot when attempting to adjust behaviors to correct system oscillations, ultimately making matters worse. For example, referral rates within a clinic can create oscillations in system behavior. The delays in the referral rate to the clinic are based on the feedback from the providers. When the providers’ schedules are at max capacity, the frontline staff stop referring. The rate of referral has dropped to zero at that moment in time. Slowly, providers get through their patient panel, and have more time where they are not seeing patients. The frontline staff is informed and start to refer patients again. There is a delay in the feedback of information between the providers and frontline staff that creates a stop and start rate of referrals into the stock. This causes oscillation in the clinic where providers are maxed out in one instance, and then have idle time as they wait for referrals in an another instance.

* **Coming Up**
    + We will view clinic data to explore how stakeholders can address issues that are unique to that setting. 
    + We will introduce the model to help stakeholders learn about thier clinic, experiment with possible changes, and run simulations to test out hypotheses. 
    + Stakeholders will use thier understanding of feedback, delays, and nonlinearities when examining thier own data within the model.
