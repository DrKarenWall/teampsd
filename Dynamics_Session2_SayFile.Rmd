## Session: Dynamics

### Key Ideas 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_star_778913_003F72.svg">

* Systems are composed of a web of interrelated stocks, flows, and feedback processes that occur over time.
* Systems are goal-seekg and tend to drift towards a state of “equillibrium” because of the dynamic relationships between positive and negative feedback loops (Gosh, 2017). 
* Unexpected system behaviors occur frequently in systems. These unintended consequences are often the result of delays in feedback 
nonlinear system behaviors. 
* An enhanced understanding of the dynamics that exist system behaviors will empower stakeholders to make informed change decisions within their system.

### Dialogue
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_750723_003F72.svg">

* Have you ever made a small change and it had a huge effect in your setting? Conversely, have you ever made a huge effort, only to have it make a small impact in your setting?
* A focus of our discussion will be to understand how the concepts of feedback and nonlinearity to help cause varying outcomes when during change-efforts.
* We want to increase our understanding of the dynamic relationships that exist within the systems, and learn about the structure in which we are embedded.

### Learning Loop

* **Ratio Exercise**
    + Following our discussion about key conecpts of Dynamics, we will map variables proposed by stakeholders and their ratios in relation to one another. 
    + Using the stock and flow diagram presented earlier, we will tell feedback stories that account for the ratio of the variables being mapped.

### Reinforcing Feedback
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651874_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

A reinforcing loop is a process that feedbacks on itself over time, causing growth or decay. Using the two variables from our Graphs Over Time exercise: morale and productivity; in a clinic setting, if morale goes up, it would cause productivity to increase. As productivity increases, that would cause morale to further increase, causing growth. 
Reinforcing loops can cause decay. For example, if morale is down, it causes productivity to decrease. A decrease in productivity would then feedback onto morale, causing morale to go down further.  

### Blanacing Feedback
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651876_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

A balancing loop is process that drives behavior towards homeostasis or an equilibrium. Using two variables from our Graphs Over Time exercise: referrals and provider availability; In a clinic setting, if the rate of referrals increases, then provider availability to see patients would decrease. As the availability of providers to see patients decreases, the rate of referrals would also decrease. Over time, the rate of referrals would slow down and balance out as the system accommodates for the constraints on provider availability.  

### Role of Delays  
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_redo_993290_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Each feedback process has a delay, and they occur throughout the system. 
For example, there is a delay of information in the clinic between the rate of referrals and provider availability to see patients. As providers reach thier capacity to see patients, they inform frontline staff to slow the rate of refferals to the clinic, when the front line staff get the message they reduce the number of patients they refer.
Where do you envision a delay occuring in the example between referral rates and provider availability? There is a delay of information when the providers inform the frontline staff to slow the rate of referrals. There is also a time delay from when the frontline staff receive the message to slow the rate of referral and act on that information. As you can imagine, the amount of delay may vary tremendously. 

### Traffic 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_traffic_924177_003F72.svg width="240" height="180"> 

I would venture to guess that we all have sat in traffic during rush hour, or when there is an accident on the freeway. Regardless of how fast you want to get to your destination, there is a feedback process that is slowing you down on the freeway. The freeway is near cacpacity, and the speed at which cars can get on is slowed. A future event that is seemingly ahead of us is impacting us in the present moment. Similarly, in the clinic, as the capacity for the clinic to see patients fills up, it feedbacks and slows the rate at which patients are referred to treatment. 
There is also a delay that occurs during traffic hour that will continue to slow your rate after the accident is cleared. Suppose the accident that is slowing traffic down is several miles ahead of you. After the accident has been cleared and all lanes are open, for an amount of time you rate will remain slowed. 
Later on, we will use the model to quantify delays or the aforementioned "specific amount of time" to help stakeholders make informed decisions about thier clinic. 

### Static Observation 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_interactive-bar-chart_151004_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Static observations provide limited information for stakeholders about the manner in which variables interact, change, and evolve over time within the system. A quarterly reports of clinic performance is an example of static observations. While these snapshots of the clinic may provide some information, they do not tell the whole story. 

### Dynamic Observation
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_line-chart_544281_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

Dynamic observation yield information about system behavior overt time. It provides valuable information about the system’s past, present, and future behavior. Using dynamic observations, stakeholders are able to identify leverage points within the system and make informed decisions about change-efforts. 

### Nonlinear System Behavior- Exponential Growth
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_graph_87995_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

A nonlinear relationship can be defined as an interaction where the input is disproportional to the output. This image represents exponential growth of productivity in the clinic. The reinforcing loop between morale and productivity caused sudden and rapid growth in a system. Thinking back to the first question about small changes having big impacts; it may be difficult to pinpoint or measure what exactly created such growth within a system. Using a model, we can identify which changes will lead the growth or change that stakeholders desire. 


### Nonlinear System Behavior- Steady State
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_graph_88002_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

As balancing loops interact with reinforcing loops, the system moves towards a steady state or an equillibrium.This image can represent the steady state of rate of referrals in the clinic. The balancing loop between the rate of referrals and provider availability causes a state of equilibrium over time. As mentioned earlier, stakeholders may have varying perspectives about what is driving system behavior. The PSD process uses the model to ellicit and makes explicit stakeholders' mental models about system behavior. The model can then be used to learn about system behavior and reach concensus about next steps to address a shared goal. 

### System Behavior– Oscillation
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_sine-wave_385866_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

As mentioned earlier, delays exists throughout a system and account for oscillations in a system. Referring back to the rate of refferals and provider availibity, the infromation delay between frontline staff and providers is common example of system oscillation. Providers reach capacity and tell frontline staff (delay) to slow referrals, the rate of referrals is decrease. The providers work through thier patient panels, as the rate of referrals is unchanged. The providers then are not seeing as many patients as they can be, and tell frontline staff (delay) that they should refer more patients. There are several delays that occured in that interaction that brief example, can you point them out? 
Stakeholders often undershoot or overshoot when attempting to adjust behaviors to correct system oscillations by focusing on the wrong variable or not understanding the correct ratio; ultimately making matters worse. This is why we need a model to learn about what is drivers the up and down time in the clinics. 

### Lesson Overview 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_molecule_784555_003F72.svg>

* The hallmark for dynamics are the feedback loops that occur throughout the system. 
* Each feedback loop has a delay that impacts system behavior. 
* Nonlinear system behavior occur when inputs are not proportional to outputs causing exponential growth or decay. 

### Feedback Loops: How nature gets its rhythms

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inVZoI1AkC8" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/inVZoI1AkC8/0.jpg" alt="Feedback Loops" width="240" height="180">

The video does an excellent job of depicting positive and negative feedback loops, the concept of nonlinearity, oscillations, and equilibrium. Depending on the system, the feedback loop interactions develop and change over time, as in each habitat. The video uses the terms positive and negative to describe feedback loops. The terms “positive” is synonymous with “reinforcing”, and “negative” is synonymous with “balancing.” 

Do you have any questions or comments about the video or anything we have covered so far?

### Ratio Exercise 
<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651873_003F72.svg width="240" height="180">

### Participatory System Dynamics Resources in R Markdown 

This is an R Markdown presentation for the "Ratio Exercise" learning loop exercise from the participatory learning session of the Team PSD Facilitation Guide. 

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 

We use R and R Markdown so that our materials are open source/free, transparent for collaboration, reproducible by others and can be used repeatedly over time for local sustainability or for adaptation to another local health care system.

### Context

This exercise is introduced after Graphs Over Team has introduced system behaviors and after stakeholders have begun to develop some consensus regarding their dynamic hypotheses.

### Purpose

* Elicit feedback loops (especially minor loops), variables within a causal chain, and initiate the more formal model that will be further developed in later learning sessions.

* Increase stakeholders' capacity for 'feedback thinking'

### Primary Nature of the Group Task

Convergent

### Time

Preparation time by facilitators: 30 minutes

Stakeholder time required during session: 10 minutes, plus 30 minutes of debriefing

### Materials Needed

1. Large erasable white surface (cling sheet or white board)
2. White board markers
3. Recorder will want to capture image in Vensim sketch or with a camera (or both)
4. Modeler or "reflector" may redraw some of the mapped feedback loops

### Inputs

This script can be used when the learners have defined pairs of stock variables whose ratio (or difference) makes sense to the team (e.g., patient panel size, staff turnover rate, etc.)

### Outputs

* Feedback loops are identfied
* Mapping of feedback effects

### Roles

- Facilitator with modest experience in participatory system dynamics; should be able to lead the group in mapping feedback effects (identify the stock variables from the prior learning sessions to set up the "Ratio Exercise" in this session).
- Skilled modelers are needed in the "modeler feedback" follow up where the feedback loops elicited by the group are integrate into more complicated "cleaned up" feedback diagrams.
- Recorder who can capture hand drawn feedback loops or those drawn in Vensim

### Steps to the Ratio Exercise

#### STEP ONE 
####  The facilitator picks out a pair of stocks to work with first.  

* Below are examples from the first session of local observational data that could represent these stocks.

###### Slide with Local Data 

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

###### Plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from Local Data

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

###### Alternative plot of the Reference Mode for Local System from an Image

#### STEP TWO 
##### The facilitator asks the learners to name the ratio or difference (e.g., patient panel size; staff turnover rate).  The facilitator adds the ratio or difference variable using the language provided by the team.  

* Different teams use different terminology for similar concepts. 
* Some teams use differences and some use ratios (e.g., "no show rate" vs. "# of intakes")

#### STEP THREE 
##### The facilitator maps the ratio (or difference variable) with the incoming arrows marked with "+" or "-" as is causally appropriate.


#### STEP FOUR
##### The facilitator asks the question, "What would happen if this ratio were to go to zero or gen unusually small" or "what would happen if this ratio where to become very large- how would the system react?"

* The stakeholders then start to tell feedback stories about how the system reacts when this key ratio (or difference) gets out of whack.  When loops are completed, the facilitator traces them out for the group adding appropriate "+" or "-," telling the stories of the loops.  *These loops are almost always balancing loops.*

#### STEP FIVE
##### Steps 2 through 4 are repeated with another set of ratios.

### Evaluation criteria:

* This script will usually fill a white board with lots of feedback loops very quickly.
* Participants will "get the hang" of what feedback loops are, how they work, and will start to look for them.
* A very good map will have feedback paths that connect to other important stocks in the system (other than simple first order loops).

### Notes
This script will further develop 'off-line.' Working iteratively with VHA mental health stakeholders, Team PSD has worked to identify a clear set of stocks and flows, and patient flow 'aging chains' that undergird the dynamics of the outpatient mental health system.  

* Given there is already a 'seed' stock and flow diagram that can be worked with in future sessions, the goal is to help the stakeholders to see how service loads (i.e., Veterans' needs or patient 'demand' for services) can be linked to mental health resource stocks (e.g., providers, scheduling hours, etc.) so that the pairings make sense.

* **Coming Up**
    + We will view clinic data to explore how stakeholders can address issues that are unique to that setting. 
    + We will introduce the model to help stakeholders learn about thier clinic, experiment with possible changes, and run simulations to test out hypotheses. 
    + Stakeholders will use thier understanding of feedback, delays, and nonlinearities when examining thier own data within the model.
