	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	Extended workweeks leads to reduced productivity via increased missed \

		devote to non-patient facing tasks -- like appointment reminder calls).  \
		Exponent controlling the effect of work hours on missed appointments. A \
		value of "1" implies the assumption that there is a direct relationship \
		between relative increases in work hours and the percent of appointments \
		missed (e.g., doubling the work hours will also double the % of \
		appointments missed).  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only \

Sensitivity of New Pt Starts to Existing Pt Care Delays=
	0
	~	Dmnl [-2,0,0.1]
	~	Exponent controlling the effect of care delay on service attractiveness. \
		The negative sign indicates that this is inversely coded, i.e., the \
		attractiveness of a service drops as care delays increase.  A value of \
		"-1" implies the assumption that doubling the time between appointments \
		for existing patients (e.g., delaying their care) will reduce the new \
		patient referral rate for that service by half.  For the same situation, a \
		value of "-0.5" would reduce the referral rate for that service, or its \
		attractiveness, to 71% of its original value, and a value of -1.5 would \
		reduce the attractiveness to only 35%.
	|

Sensitivity of RVI to Work Pressure=
	0
	~	Dmnl [0,2,0.1]
	~	Exponent controlling the effect of work pressure on delays in care (i.e., \
		the scheduled Return Visit Interval for current patients). A value of "1" \
		implies the assumption that there is a direct relationship between work \
		pressure and RVI (e.g., doubling the work pressure will also double the \
		RVI).  For the same situation, a value of "0.5" would only increase the \
		RVI by 41% over its original value, and a value of 1.5 would increase the \
		RVI by 182% over the original value.
