## Traffic Jam

-	Use traffic jam analogy to reintroduce stocks and flows
-	“In the same way we ask ourselves, what is causing this traffic jam, we may be asking ourselves what is driving these state measures in our clinics?”

     
## Valve/Flow; Flow/Faucet

-	Clarify definitions of stock/flow (use the following two icons as well to understand rates versus drivers)

## Static Observation

## Dynamic Observation Over Time

## Modeling to Learn
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_communication_884666_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-	By this point, we understand that we all have different mental models of what we think is driving the stocks
-	We need to elicit and make explicit these models by making hypotheses 


## Data Dialogue

-	The first step is model specification, which occurs through a dialogue about what variables and relationships appear most important
-	We may go from less specific to more specific to determine 


## Data Visualization
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_visualization_741760_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-	As we get more specific, we conduct model reviews and clean up the model
-	During the review, we pay specific attention to variables and linkages that involved changes or were questionable
-	There may be several model reviewing sessions prior to moving on


## System Behavior

-	As we simplify the model, we make sure we are using a system dynamics approach 

## Sliders/Mixer

-	Currently operating under the equfinality assumtpion that diverse initial conditions and organizational pathways may result in the same outcome
-	However, a focus on local determinants of system behavior may be more appropriate to develop successful implementation plans


## Feedback
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651873_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-	We then identify major feedback loops as well as major stocks in system that will be needed for our formal simulation model

## Synthesis

-	Formulate and test the model 

## Learning Loop Exercise : Modeling to Learn

- Group model building exercise

## Lesson Overview "Putting it Together"

-	The main role of simulation is to test hypotheses about the relationship between the system structure and system behavior using local data and local expertise.
