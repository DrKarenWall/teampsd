# Preface

## Introduction

    Providers, patients, policy makers and scientists each have a stake in ensuring all patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), alcohol use disorder (AUD), depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), receive timely, evidence-based care. In the Veterans Health Administration (VA), these common, costly conditions comprise the majority of outpatient addiction/mental health needs (1–3). But highly effective treatments such as evidence-based psychotherapy (EBPsy) and evidence-based pharmacotherapy (EBPharm) reach only 3-28% of patients (4–6). National evidence-based practice (EBP) dissemination programs (7–11), policies (12–14), incentivized quality measures (15, 16), and EBP-focused electronic health records (17) have been insufficient to realize greater EBP reach (18–20), key to preventing chronic impairment, relapse, overdose, (21–23) and suicide (24–26) among Veterans.
    Like most health systems (27–29), VA uses team huddles and audit-and-feedback (AF) processes to coordinate and improve EBPsy/EBPharm care. But AF outcomes vary widely (30), with the least success for complex tasks like multidisciplinary EBP continuity and coordination (31). Research suggests that solving complex, multidisciplinary challenges such as team EBP delivery requires addressing system-level causes (35–40). Participatory System Dynamics (PSD) offers a method of active group learning, using system diagrams and simulation models (41, 42), that builds capacity for understanding and managing causal system dynamics (43, 44). Simulation modeling overcomes cognitive limitations (45, 46) to prospectively restructure delay and feedback dynamics that influence EBP reach over time (47). Using such models lets teams test their hypotheses and gain shared insights about how decisions within their control interact to affect outcomes they care about.

    The Modeling to Learn course leads front-line clinic staff, working together in their teams, through a progressive PSD process designed to:
    •	Enhance VA team members’ knowledge and skill in systems thinking; 
    •	Make VA data, initiatives and standards transparent to clinic staff;
    •	Help teams understand complex interactions among factors – including decisions within their control and resource limitations that constrain them – that are difficult, if not impossible, to see without data and models; and
    •	Empower teams to generate ongoing quality improvements in both patient care and work life.
    Four system dynamics models of limited EBP reach were developed by a team of stakeholders and other experts.
    •	Lindsey Zimmerman, PhD, Implementation Scientist, National Center for PTSD, Dissemination & Training Division (NCPTSD-DT) – Team PSD Project Lead and Principal Investigator
    •	Stacey Park, BA, Team PSD Project Administrator, NCPTSD-DT

    The models help explain “reach as a function of local front-line staff decisions and available resources (48, 49). Three focus on specific services: Care Coordination (CC), Medication Management (MM), and Psychotherapy (Psy). A fourth, Aggregate (Agg) model looks at combined services across a local VA mental/behavioral health clinic. 
    Existing VA health system data was extracted using standard definitions for diagnoses, appointments, visits and EBPs, and calculated model parameter values for local teams  (15, 50). Models define mechanisms identified by stakeholders using systems theory and calculus, which are validated against historical data (51). PSD learning is via real-time visual emergence of local causes of EBP reach in virtual experiments (52–54). Simulations are a safe way to build systems thinking into EBP decisions (44, 55, 56).

# Course Guidance

## Staffing and Roles

    Lead Facilitator
    Assistant Facilitator
    Subject Matter Experts
    Logistics Coordinator
    Communications Coordinator
    Team Lead

## Target Audience

Modeling to Learn is designed for teams of multidisciplinary staff in VAHS outpatient mental health, including psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, counselors, certified peer-support specialists, other professional disciplines, and trainees (e.g., practica, interns, residents and fellows).

## Technology and Mechanics

    Adobe Connect – application, computer requirements, webcam, VOIP or phone recommended?
    
    Data interface in SharePoint – software?, browser specs, login, other? (Detailed instructions in Appendix C.)
    
    Model interface in Forio – browser specs, login, other? (Detailed instructions in Appendix D.)

## Course Schedule

    The course is designed to be delivered in twelve, 60-minute sessions. For many teams that have weekly huddles, every other week’s session will be devoted to MTL, so the course will take place over a period of 6 months.

    While the course progresses through increasingly complex concepts and models, each session stands alone to the extent possible, so that someone who misses a session or joins the course in-progress can participate with minimal extra coaching.

    The course at-a-glance is shown below. [add Overview paragraph and Learning objectives]

## Appendix C. Using the Data Interface in SharePoint

## Appendix D. Using the Modeling to Learn Interface in Forio

Forio is the company providing the Epicenter Platform where the VA PSD Simulation (sometimes, just referred to as "simulation"), based on the four Vensim models (sometimes, just referred to as "models") can be accessed.

Author - In Epicenter, an Author has "superuser" capabilities like access to the Epicenter directories. They also can "impersonate a user".  Key members of the VA PSD team (PI and others) as well as Forio team members are Authors.  

End User - In Epicenter, an "end user" is anyone who can "play" the simulations built on Epicenter. In our case, it's the Facilitators and participants (e.g., members of the ATS Team at Menlo Park).  

Access as an Author or End User is done via different login credentials. This is to clarify for Epicenter which permissions to grant to the individual. 

End Users can be Facilitator/Admin, Team Lead, or Player.

A World is Epicenter’s construct that allows us to assign the Team Lead and Player to the same VA PSD team. For our purposes, a "team" = "World". 

A Facilitator is set at a "Group" level. They are not assigned to a particular “World” but have access to all the "Worlds" in the Group. They also have access to features such as "chat with a Team Lead", "compare team results", etc.  A Facilitator can access the results of the different teams, but is NOT on a team, and therefore does not have the ability to run an experiment.

Each team (or World) will have one Team Lead who will have the "gameplay" capabilities, such as making decisions, playing the simulation, saving results, etc. 

Each team will have additional Players, who will also have "gameplay" capabilities, but not the ability to "start" a game. A team can only have one active game at a time.

Some individuals may be given multiple login credentials. For example, a Facilitator can "run experiments as a team member" if they log in as Player on a team. Also a person who is on more than one team can have login credentials for each one.
