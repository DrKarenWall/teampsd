Comment:  
1) In expanded outputs tile, need to be consistent in the "you" language.  Under "Our hypothesis" - "Outline the systems story *your* team believes..." and Under "Our decisions" - "Based on what your team learned in this experiment, what changes *your* team ready to make..."  
2) Make arrow bold for feedback/balancing loops like it is done in the VenSim models  
3) Use of abbreviations are not consistent. Sometimes words are written out and sometimes they are abbreviated.  
 a) appointments vs appts  
 b) percentage vs %  
 c) additional vs add
