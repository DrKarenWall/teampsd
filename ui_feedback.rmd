Comment:  
1) VA PSD icon should not have blue highlight on the "Team" part  
2) Using sentence case  
3) Ability to return to "home page" by clicking on the VA PSD icon  

Model: CC Model v. MM Model  
Comment:  
1) CC says "balancing existing and new patients" whereas the MM says "balancing new and existing patients"  
2) CC has correction of "overbook percentage" but MM says "overbook amount" (near appointment supply)    

Model: MM Model  
Comment:  
1) Language for X waivers: "Manual Slots Allocation by % (w X) / Manual Slots Allocation by % (no X) vs. "Change in Percentage of Appt. Slots - Provider has X-Waiver"  
a) Wouldn't the converse of "w" be "w/o"  
b) It goes from using "w X" language to "Provider has X-Waiver"  


Model: All  
Comment:  
1) In expanded outputs tile, need to be consistent in the "you" language.  Under "Our hypothesis" - "Outline the systems story *your* team believes..." and Under "Our decisions" - "Based on what your team learned in this experiment, what changes *your* team ready to make..."  
2) Make arrow bold for feedback/balancing loops like it is done in the VenSim models  
3) Use of abbreviations are not consistent. Sometimes words are written out and sometimes they are abbreviated.  
a) appointments vs appts  
b) percentage vs %  
c) additional vs add  
4) Since "loops" cannot be clicked without clicking "patients in care," there should be some way to indicate that i.e. to number it 1 and 2  
5) Cannot see output and decision tiles at the same time  
6) Can only advance simulation by 1, 3, or 5 weeks
