### Lesson Hexagon- Key Ideas 

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_star_778913_003F72.svg">


- Model simulations provide a means to make mental models
more explicit and test assumptions, particularly surrounding implementation plans.

- Assist stakeholders in evaluating implementation plans by
using model simulation to visualize dynamic relationships.

- Increase stakeholder EBP-specific capacity by
understanding the impact of system factors, such as intake referral rate, on
the level of state measures, such as amount of patients pending intake
scheduling.


### Definitions 

- Static observation/Stock

- Dynamic observation

- Flows

- Feedback



### Dialogue- Hexagon

- What thoughts do providers have on variables in the model?

- What are some hypotheses about what is driving the rates of those variables?

- Discuss major stocks, feedback loops, and dynamics



### Learning Loop

-Group Model Building exercise: split up into groups and discuss 1) major stocks, 2) hypotheses about what is driving those stocks



### Lesson Overview

- The main role of simulation is to test hypotheses about the relationship between the system structure and system behavior using local
data and local expertise.



## Healthcare

- So you’ve learned a lot about the system structure and processes that impact system behavior. Is anyone thinking “what now?” 
- What would you want to do next? (Hope people say test some ideas about why the system is acting this way)
- In this last session we are going to start to talk about modeling as simulation guided. Through this process we can actually test and
observe dynamic hypotheses. 



## Traffic Jam 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_traffic_924177_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- Lets take a look again at the traffic during rush hour metaphor that was brought up in the dynamics session. When you are
stuck in a traffic jam, I’m sure many hypotheses come up about what is going on- “someone is moving too slow,” “everyone just got out of
work,” etc. etc.
- In the same way we ask ourselves, what is causing this traffic jam, we may be asking ourselves what is driving these
[performance] measures in our clinics?
- The same way we now understand that there is an interdependence between the rate at which traffic moves, the capacity of the highway, and the occurrence of accidents and delays, we understand that there is a dynamic relationship between the capacity of our local clinics, the rates at which people are being referred, being seen, and delay.
   
## Stock and Flow
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_washing_514155_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- To delve further into the dynamic relationships in a system, we must understand stocks and flows. 
- Stocks are the levels or states of variables. Many clinic managers have this data- quarterly reports are a prime example of a stock. If you freeze the clinic at any given time, you can report the level of patients getting referred in, patients getting seen, discharged etc. 
- Managers typically don't have is what is driving those levels, which is the flow. An understanding of the flows, the ability to manipulate and test out what is affecting those flows, would promote QI by testing out those hypotheses about our performance measures before restructuring the entire clinic.
- A metaphor that is used to illustrate the relationship between stocks and flows would have us imagine we were trying to fill a sink, perhaps to do our dishes. The amount of water flowing- the stock- is dependent upon how much you open or close the valve - the flow. However, the relationship is dynamic because we have to monitor the rate of water flowing into and out of the sink as well.  If we have an equal rate of water flowing into and out of the sink, then the level of the water in the sink is stabilized. If we have more water flowing in than out, our sink overflows. If we have more water flowing out than in, we will never be able to fill the sink. 


## Static Observation 
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_bar-chart-decline_869492_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- Without system dynamics we often make hypotheses focused on the amount of water in the sink at a single time, the stock.  Similarly, quarterly reports of clinic performances are stocks, they provide some information but not the whole story.


## Dynamic Observation Over Time
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_line-chart_544281_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- With a systems thinking approach, we propose dynamic hypotheses that take into account the complexity in the structure that determines
the system behavior. 

## Modeling to Learn
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_communication_884666_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

-	By this point, we understand that we all have different mental models of what we think is driving the stocks
-	We need to elicit and make explicit these models by making hypotheses 

## System Behavior -

-	 The first step is model specification, determining what variables and relationships appear most important.

## Local Data

<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_settings_339117_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">

- But let’s think back to the slinky metaphor. Why did that slinky bounce up and down? (The structure of the slinky, its coils, causes the physical behavior of it bouncing up and down). The structure determines the behavior with the slinky, and with the clinical setting. National change efforts targeted at limited EBP reach are not accounting for local system structure. We have to understand the local structure to understand the behavior of limited EBP reach.
-While we are using administrative data that everyone has, and common procedural technology, the question of "why would that work here" can only be understood by using our local data and focusing on local systems. Remember that without system dynamics we tend to operate under the equifinality assumption that diverse initial conditions and organizational pathways may result in the same outcome. 

## Feedback
<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/lzim/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_feedback_651873_003F72.svg" width="720" height="540">
 - In coming to a “systems” understanding of the clinical setting, we must remember to identify major feedback loops as well as major stocks in the system.
 - Point to graphs over time exercise and the understanding of what feedback loops appear important for their system.  



## Synthesis

- As we get more specific, we conduct model reviews and clean up the model
- During the review, we pay specific attention to variables and linkages that needed changes or were questionable
- There may be several model reviewing sessions prior to moving on
- Throughout this process, particularly as we simplify the model, we make sure we are using a system dynamics approach 


## Learning Loop Exercise : Modeling to Learn

- Group model building exercise
- At this point, we would like participants to engage in a model building exercise. 
- People should break up into groups and come up with at least 5 hypotheses about what is driving their clinic measures. 

## Lesson Overview/Debrief

<img src=https://cdn.rawgit.com/LZIM/teampsd/hexagon_icons/np_molecule_784555_003F72.svg width="720" height="540">
 - Review with participants the hypotheses they came up with
 - What mental models were made explicit? Were there differences in mental models? Did people come to
a consensus? What feedback loops were identified? What questions remain?
-	Recall that the main role of simulation is to test hypotheses about the relationship between the system structure and system behavior using local data and local expertise. We
will continue to conduct modeling sessions to simplify and test the model.
